The msarnoff.org License
========================

I don't like long license documents, so I'll keep this short.
You can use and modify this code any way you like, as long as you:

- credit me and link to msarnoff.org in your readme/website/blog/etc.
- let me know if you're using it for something cool, so I can potentially
  add a link on my site;
- ask my permission before using it (with or without modifications) in a
  commercial product.
